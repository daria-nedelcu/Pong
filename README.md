Pong
====

Classic game of Pong in Python


This game was developed as part of an assignment for Rice University's
course Interactive Programming in Python. Due to it being developed on
an online platform, it might not run in every Python IDE. Therefore,
the easiest way to run this program is to access this link[1] and
click Run.

It is an implementation of the classic game of Pong, in which the keys 
'up' and 'down' control the righthand paddle and the keys 'w' and 's' 
control the lefthand paddle. It also features a restart button which
cleares he scores.
